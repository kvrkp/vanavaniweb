<p class="red">Career Fair</p><br>
We had circulated a 10 minute audio to the government school authorities in the beginning 
of the month. This covered three areas - competitive exams, computer knowledge and 
communication skills. <br><br>
On hearing this, the authorities agreed to send a group of X standard students.<br><br>
On career fair day, we held 2 sessions to cover about 80 students. For the girls, focus was 
put on computers and communication skills. For the boys, the focus shifted to mechanical 
and electrical engineering. Since the majority of the participants came from lower 
economic backgrounds and many of them had trouble understanding English, the oration 
was done both in Tamil and in English.<br><br>
The material included covered all the diploma courses that could be taken after X std. 
Focus was on landing a job as soon as possible with the least expense in studies. 
The feedback was encouraging. The teachers who accompanied said that 
these students had never got this kind of exposure before. It was an eye opener for them.<br><br> 
<p class="red">Interviewing the teachers</p><br>
We also advertised for teachers in mass media - indeed.com, newspaper ads and the website. 
We got a number of profiles and we did a few phone and face to face interviews. 
The idea is to get teachers with good English communication skills with appropriate 
qualification.<br> 
<p class="red">Getting expenses and vacation register online</p><br>
We also managed to get the daily expenses register and vacation register online 
with password protection. This helps to keep an accurate record and observe patterns 
in expenditure and leave taking.<br>
<p class="red">Asset Exam conducted for teachers</p><br>
All teachers wrote the Asset Exam meant for IXth standard. This helped to identify strengths 
and weaknesses so that we can conduct better teacher training and also use the teachers 
in their areas of strength.<br> 
<p class="red">Discussion on setting up factory like training at the school</p><br>
On March 15, we had a discussion with our chief sponsors regarding setting up some training 
facilities at the school. We decided to setup a small facility with a lathe and some 
electrical apparatus for students to get trained in. Details need to be worked out.<br>
<p class="red">Student Exchange Program</p><br>
We also approached the principal of Sri Sankara Senior Secondary School, Adayar, Chennai 
and got her approval to send 2 children from Vanavani. They could sit along with the usual 
classes and get the benefit of education from CBSE trained teachers. We have to work out 
a suitable time next school year to do this. We will also get a couple of students from 
the city to study at Vanavani.<br>
<p class="red">Skype based mentoring</p><br>
We would like to thank Mrs Jaya for her initiative in mentoring a group of 5 children over 
skype. She has been able to get them to speak freely and is able to spot strengths and 
weaknesses in the children. We hope to increase this to more children once school reopens.<br>
